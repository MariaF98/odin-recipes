    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often
      thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs,
      milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying
      pan, often frying with oil or butter. It is a type of batter bread.
      Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably eaten in
      prehistoric societies

      The earliest attested references to tagenias are in the works of the
      5th-century BC poets Cratinus and Magnes.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups powdered milk</li>
      <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl.

      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop
        the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each
        pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3
        minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with
        remaining batter.
